      HE Indians were formerly lords of the soil we now occupy, and obtained a
      subsistance principally by hunting and fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They generally lived in villages, containing from fifty to five hundred
      families. Their houses, called <i>wigwams</i>, were usually constructed of
      poles, one end being driven into the ground, and the other bent over so as
      to meet another fastened in like manner; both being joined together at the
      top, and covered with the bark of trees. Small holes were left open for
      windows, which were closed in bad weather with a piece of bark. They made
      their fire in the centre of the wigwam, leaving a small hole for a chimney
      in the top of the roof.

      They had no chairs, but sat upon skins, or mats, spread upon the ground,
      which also served them for beds. Their clothes were principally made of
      the skins of animals, which in winter were sewed together with the fur
      side turned inwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians were very fond of trinkets and ornaments, and often decorated
      their heads with feathers, while fine polished shells were suspended from
      their ears.

      HE following anecdote is related of a Pawnee brave, or warrior, (son of
      Red Knife.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of twenty-one, the heroic deeds of this brave had acquired for
      him in his nation the rank of the bravest of the braves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savage practice of torturing and burning to death their prisoners
      existed in this nation. An unfortunate female of the Paduca nation, taken
      in war, was destined to this horrid death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just when the funeral pile was to be kindled this young warrior, having
      unnoticed prepared two fleet horses, with the necessary provisions, sprang
      from his seat, liberated the victim, seized her in his arms, placed her on
      one of the horses, mounted the other himself, and made the utmost speed
      toward the nation and friends of the captive! The multitude, dumb and
      nerveless, made no effort to rescue their victim from her deliverer. They
      viewed it as the immediate act of the Great Spirit, submitted to it
      without a murmur, and quietly retired to their village.

      S an Indian was straying through a village on the Kennebec, he passed a
      gentleman standing at his store door, and begged a piece of tobacco. The
      person stepped back, and selected a generous piece, for which he received
      a gruff &ldquo;tank you,&rdquo; and thought no more of the affair. Three or four
      months afterwards, he was surprised at an Indian&rsquo;s coming into the store
      and presenting him with a beautiful miniature birch canoe, painted and
      furnished with paddles to correspond. On asking the meaning of it, he was
      told, &ldquo;Indian not forget; you give me tobacco; me make this for you.&rdquo;

      N his return home to his hut one day, an Indian discovered that his
      venison which had been hung up to dry, had been stolen After going some
      distance, he met some persons, of whom he inquired if they had seen a <i>little,
      old, white</i> man, with a short gun, and accompanied by a small dog with
      a bobtail. They replied in the affirmative; and upon the Indian&rsquo;s assuring
      them that the man thus described had stolen his venison, they desired to
      be informed how he was able to give such a minute description of a person
      whom he had not seen. The Indian answered thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thief I know is a little man, by his having made a pile of stones in
      order to reach the venison from the height I hung it standing on the
      ground; that he is an old man, I know by his short steps, which I have
      traced over the dead leaves in the woods; that he is a white man, I know
      by his turning out his toes when he walks, which an Indian never does; his
      gun I know to be short by the mark which the muzzle made by rubbing the
      bark of the tree on which it leaned; that his dog is small, I know by his
      tracks; and that he has a bob-tail I discovered by the mark of it in the
      dust where he was sitting at the time his master was taking down the
      meat.&rdquo;

      N one of the frequent wars among the different tribes of Indians, a Pequot
      was pursued by a Narraganset Indian. The Pequot skulked be-a rock, and
      raising his hat on his gun, held it up just above the rock, so that the
      hat alone was visible on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Narraganset, who was at some distance, perceiving the hat, and
      supposing of course that the head of the Pequot was in it, crept softly up
      within a few feet and fired. But directly he had the mortification to find
      that he had thrown away his powder. The Pequot&rsquo;s gun was still loaded, and
      he discharged it to effect upon the poor Narraganset.

      T happened, during the Revolutionary war, that a treaty was held with the
      Indians, at which Lafayette was present. The object was to unite the
      various tribes in amity with America. The majority of the chiefs were
      friendly, but there was much opposition made to it, more especially by a
      young warrior, who declared that when an alliance was entered into with
      America, he should consider the sun of his country as set forever. In his
      travels through the Indian country, when lately in America, it happened at
      a large assemblage of chiefs that Lafayette referred to the treaty in
      question, and turning to Red Jacket, said, &ldquo;Pray, tell me, if you can,
      what has become of that daring youth, who so decidedly opposed all our
      propositions for peace and amity?

      HEN General Lincoln went to make peace with the Creek Indians, one of the
      chiefs asked him to sit down on a log. He was then desired to move, and in
      a few minutes to move still further. The request was repeated until the

      URING the time of Indian troubles, a friendly Indian visited Governor
      Jenks, of Rhode Island, when the governor took occasion to request him to
      let him know if any strange Indian should come to his wigwam. This the
      Indian promised to do, and the governor agreed to give him a mug of flip
      if he should give such information. Some time after, the Indian came
      again, and said, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Gubernor, strange Indian come to my house last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He no speak,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not speak at all?&rdquo; inquired the governor. &ldquo;No, he no speak at all.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;That looks suspicious,&rdquo; said his excellency, and inquired if he was there
      still. Being told that he was, the governor ordered the promised mug of
      flip. When this was disposed of, and the Indian was about to depart, he
      mildly said, &ldquo;Mr. Gubernor, my squaw have child last night.&rdquo; The governor,
      finding the strange Indian was a new-born papoose, was glad to find there
      was no cause for alarm.

      HE following striking display of Indian character occurred some years
      since in a town in Maine. An Indian of the Kennebec tribe, remarkable for
      his good conduct, received a grant of land from the state, and fixed
      himself in a township, where a number of families settled. Though not ill
      treated, yet the common prejudice against the Indians prevented any
      sympathy with him. This was shown at the death of his only child, when
      none of the people came near him. Shortly afterwards he went to some of
      the inhabitants, and said to them, &ldquo;When white man&rsquo;s child die, Indian man
      be sorry-he help bury him: when my child die, no one speak to me&mdash;I
      make his grave alone&mdash;I can&rsquo;t live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave up his farm, dug up the body of his child, and carried it with him
      two hundred miles through the forest, to join the Canada Indians. What
      energy and depth of feeling does this specimen of Indian character
      exhibit!

      Spanish traveller met an Indian in the desert; they were both on
      horseback. The Spaniard, fearing that his horse, which was none of the
      best, would not hold out till the end of his journey, asked the Indian,
      whose horse was young, strong, and Spirited, to exchange with him. This
      the Indian refused. The Spaniard therefore began a quarrel with him. From
      words they proceeded to blows. The aggressor being well armed, proved too
      powerful for the native. He seized his horse, mounted him, and pursued his
      journey.

      E was closely followed to the nearest town by the Indian, who immediately
      complained to a judge. The Spaniard was obliged to appear, and bring the
      horse with him. He treated the Indian as an impostor, affirming that the
      horse was his property, that he had always had him in his possession, and
      that he had raised him from a colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no proof to the contrary, the judge was about dismissing the
      parties, when the Indian cried out,&mdash;&ldquo;The horse is mine, and I&rsquo;ll
      prove it!&rdquo; He immediately took off his mantle, and with it instantly
      covered the head of the animal; then addressing the judge,&mdash;&ldquo;Since
      this man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;affirms that he has raised the horse from a colt,
      command him to tell of which eye he is blind.&rdquo; The Spaniard, who would not
      seem to hesitate, instantly answered, &ldquo;Of the right eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is neither blind of the right eye,&rdquo; replied the Indian, &ldquo;nor of the
      left.&rdquo; The judge decreed him the horse, and the Spaniard to be punished as
      a robber.

      HE politeness of these people in conversation is indeed carried to excess;
      since it does not permit them to contradict or deny the truth of what is
      asserted in their presence. By this means they indeed avoid disputes; but
      then it becomes difficult to know their minds, or what impression you make
      upon them. When any of them come into our towns, our people are apt to
      crowd around them, gaze upon them, and incommode them when they desire to
      be private; this they esteem great rudeness, and the effect of the want of
      instruction in the rules of civility and good manners. &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; say
      they, &ldquo;as much curiosity as you, and when you come info our towns, we wish
      for opportunities of looking at you; but for this purpose we hide
      ourselves behind bushes where you are to pass, and never intrude ourselves
      into your company.&rdquo;
